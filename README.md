## Timed Quiz


### "Blitz" style Javascript Quiz
This is a fast paced quiz meant to challenge quick thinking under pressure. The pressure is applied to the user by forcing a very limited amount of time to complete the four questions.  Additional stress is applied to the user via a time-loss "punishment" for selecting an incorrect answer.

### Instructions
#### Start
Click on "Start" to begin the quiz.  You will have 30 seconds to answer 4 randomly selected multiple choice questions.  An incorrect answer deducts 3 seconds from the clock.  
#### Reset
At anytime you can click "Reset" to stop the quiz and return to the beginning.  The questions will be reshuffled and you can begin again.
#### High Scores
Clicking "High Scores" will display the current High Score list at the bottom of the page
